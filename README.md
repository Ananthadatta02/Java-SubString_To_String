# Java-SubString_To_String
This Java program prints all substrings of a given string. It defines the class SubStrings_of_String in the package subString. The main method initializes "abc" and uses nested loops to extract substrings. The outer loop sets the start index, while the inner loop sets the end index, generating and printing substrings using substring(i, j).
